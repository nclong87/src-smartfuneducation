        <p>Hello! I am Happy Genie, your happy assistant. Congratulations on joining our exciting journey ahead.</p>
        <p>As you have accidentally found this secret map, the Map that leads to you a very precious treasure – a successful career with your dream job, let's open it. Start looking carefully into the map and its guidance.</p>
        <p>Reading the ancient script in the map, you'll learn that there is a Huge Treasure Trunk in the Northeast of the region and your job is to find 7 keys in order to open the Huge Trunk of Great Treasure. So first of all, you have to collect each of 7 keys, one by one...</p>

        <h5>Rule :</h5>
        <p>You have to complete many quests to find a way to each Key’s place. After finishing one quest, you will receive coins. These coins are very important since you have to spend it all the way to the Trunk.</p>
        
        <h5>Earning and spending rules :</h5>
        <p>The first 3 quests are free of charge. From the 4th quest, you have to pay coin to receive the new quest (or redo the old quests as well). After finishing one quest, you will receive coin and badge as a reward. The badge is given only once.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you will need help from your friends in order to finish some quests. When your friends finish helping you, you will give coin to the friend as an appreciation.</p>
        <p>There will be bonus quests pop up with time limitation. You then will want to complete the quest to earn more coin. Remember coins are very important!!!</p>
        <p>Now start your first quest: Team up!</p>
        <p>You have to team up a five or more members. Remember, in order to pay for each KEY, the AVERAGE amount of coin of your team need to be sufficient and ALL the members must reach the same place (the quest to receive the Key). Then this amount will be reduced in each player account. So the players need to cooperate well together!!! </p>
